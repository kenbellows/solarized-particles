# solarized particles

This is a little experiment to play around with color and particle behaviors using swarm dynamics.

The goal is particles swarming in and out of and around a central "nest", with different group of particles colored differently and having a tendency to swarm with like colors. The background should be a unique color that no particles have.

Every second or so, a random particle or ten should change color (through a color transition effect) and react acordingly, seeking out its nearest swarm of like colors. Occasionally, every fifteen to thirty seconds or so, the background should change colors, at which point any particle with the color just transitioned to should transition to the color that the background just transitioned from.

I want to use Ethan Schoonover's Solarized color scheme as the bank of colors to transition between.
