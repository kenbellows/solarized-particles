        <h3><a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h3>

        <p><strong>I like simulations.</strong> I like building them, playing with them, tweaking them to see what sorts of effects I can produce.</p>

        <p><strong>I <em>love</em> the HTML5 canvas.</strong> It is, to me, the greatest addition to the web since JavaScript was standardized. I don't use it enough.</p>

        <p><strong>I want to combine these two interests</strong> in the form of a particle simulation. I have grand plans to play with colors, gravity effects, simple artificial intelligence, swarm dynamics, randomized interference to observe behaviors, ... lots of stuff.</p>

        <h3><a id="building-as-i-go" class="anchor" href="#building-as-i-go" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building As I Go</h3>

        <p>In the interest of being able to show off what I do, I'll be pushing to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch of this repository regularly (in an automated fashion, if I can figure it out) to update this little site with the latest version of the simulator. It won't be very interesting at first, but over time it will grow. Or that's the plan.</p>

        <h3><a id="termcasting-as-i-go" class="anchor" href="#termcasting-as-i-go" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Termcasting As I Go</h3>

        <p>I also want to record my coding efforts in order to document my progress. This won't always be possible, dependingon my current environment, but I want to at least record the most interesting developments. I'll use <a href="https://asciinema.org/">asciinema</a> to do it, and I'll be linking to the casts on this site on the <a href="./termcasts">Termcasts</a> page.</p>

        <p>For (somewhat) more fleshed out and specific plans, see <a href="https://github.com/kenbellows/solarized-particles/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a> in the master branch.</p>
